# Group-Messaging-App
Our chat app is a TCP based messaging application that is designed to facilitate text communication between two devices. One of the devices acts as a server that listens for communications and the other acts as a client that connects to the server. Sockets are a fundamental part of the TCP/IP protocol suite, allowing for network communication between devices.  The app can handle one client connection at a time. 
The primary objective of our chat application is creating a simple yet effective communication channel between 2 different devices. By using TCP, we can guarantee that messages are delivered accurately and in order. The Client can connect to the server device by simply inputting their IP address and correct port. Once a connection is established, both server and client devices can send each other messages and communicate with each other.
Our application had 3 different Key features, Single Client connection, Reliable Data Transmission, and a User-Friendly Interface.
The challenges we faced on this application were managing the threads for handling client connections and connecting multiple clients on the application. Error handling and creating databases that stored our information when creating profiles also proved to be difficult.
